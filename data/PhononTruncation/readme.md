# Test different truncations

We see that in the unperturbed regime ($\kappa>\omega$), the truncation of the phonons changes the dynamics completely.
You can see this by comparing the [Phonon time evolution with truncation 11](Phonon-density_11.png)
with the [Phonon time evolution with truncation 16](Phonon-density_16.png).
Notice the different colormaps!!

First guess: Population of high states is not negligible. To check this we measure the occupation of the states directly
in the [file](quick.h5).
